**Post-growth mitigation scenarios to reduce multidimensional inequalities between world region** - Gabriele, Dabbaghian ; Julien, Lefèvre ; Céline, Guivarch
Persistent inequalities in incomes, energy uses and living standards between world regions remain a major challenge for climate change mitigation. While current scenarios increasingly promote sufficiency in high-income countries, few consider post-growth transitions that simultaneously enable development in the Global South. Here, we use a hybrid integrated assessment model to explore four global mitigation scenarios that combine regionally differentiated carbon pricing, sufficiency policies, and post-growth strategies. We show that only a scenario featuring post-growth transitions in high-income countries and rapid convergence in productivity across regions reduces multidimensional inequalities to unprecedented low levels — while remaining within a 2°C carbon budget. When taken individually, regional differentiation of carbon prices or sufficiency policies are insufficient to meet social thresholds for all regions. Our findings highlight the potential of post-growth frameworks to drive structural economic change and support multidimensional inequality reduction, underscoring the need for scenario modeling that integrates macroeconomic and distributive dynamics.
